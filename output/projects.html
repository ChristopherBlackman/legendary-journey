					<p>Welcome to my projects, these are things that I have either spent to much of my life wasted away on that I just had
					to put it up here or something that I think was quite neat when making it. Although now I might just frown upon the code
					of the past. Kind of like that feeling when you see a picture of your self 10 years ago or maybe it&rsquo;s those baby
					photos. Who knows.</p>

						<dd>
							<p>Just me playing with fractals and procedural world generation. I found a neat web site that explained the 
							mid-point displacement algorithm and after a long walk I decided that I wanted to try making it in python with 
							pygame. I decided to use a linked list as it was easier to manipulate, add onto and inject seed points into it.
							There was also a 3D fractal algorithm of this, but I decided that I would make that for another day. </p>

						<dd>
							<p>Since I use Manga Storm quite a bit, I had been a bit worried about it getting taken down from the app store. So 
							I decided to create a program that will decode their backup which was in quite a simple format (except for a hash
							function value). I then converted the data that I had into JSON format for me or other people to use in case I
							wanted to switch apps at some point in time. Still want to add the python arguments module inside as well as some
							kind of regular expression to decode it far faster and reduce code. </p>

						<dd>
							<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/guyhughes" target="_blank">Guy Hughes</a> for helping me get this module
							setup with the scsprof bot on our irc channel working. If you want to join it's at hack.carlton on freenode.
							Anyway it pulls jokes from a Chuck Norris api dictionary on the web and displays it in chat. Come to our channel
							and go check it out!!</p>

							<p>The Real Slime Ritual, a Game made in less than 48 hours during Game Jam with some friends. 
							If you really Liked Super Meat boy then your really gonna love this game. The game was created 
							with the open source game engine Superpowers (great for looking up documentation), which was a 
							html5/js designed engine. Best of all it was synchronous, meaning it one person made a mistake 
							then everyone would end up with that mistake at the same time. Pain in the arse when we leave the 
							development server on a locked account (and the person has gone home) at 3am in the morning. 
							Despite that still really fun. Go check it out.</p>
							
							<p>I'll put a link to the game soon. Just have to get the game engine and compile it.</p>

						<dd>
							<p>One of those projects where you barely knew anything yet you still prevail. Anyway this 
							is with me and my friends back in high school (Dylan, Marcio &amp; Quenten). Luckily at the
							time we were able to have Macadamian come in an be our mentors, so shout out to them for being
							awesome. Anyway this program was a lot of firsts for use as it includes Restful api, Parse api
							(which should no longer be a thing anymore) and building an app with Cordova. Overall this
							was more of a learning experience and if you enjoyed the game titan, with this code you can get
							a feeling similar to that game once you or I replace the database and make a server (preferably
							in python) to replace the old Parse server code.</p>
